In the second session, we will dive into the how-tos of SwiftUI, Apple's innovative framework for building user interfaces. 
This week, students will explore core concepts like Views, Modifiers, and View Composition, and learn how to manage Multiple Views, 
ScrollViews, and Navigation in SwiftUI. This module is designed to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in building and structuring user interfaces using SwiftUI.

**Week 3 (2 February):** Advanced Slide Session 2

The third session continues our exploration into SwiftUI, building upon the concepts introduced in the last session. Enhancing the understanding and skills in creating user interfaces. 
We will reinforce and expand upon the concepts of Views, Modifiers, View Composition, ScrollView, and Navigation, with a focus on practical application.

**Week 4 (9 February):** Consulting Session

This last week, our course will focus on handling unexpected values and understanding data structures, crucial aspects of robust programming in Swift. 
Additionally, this week includes a special consulting session dedicated to the WWDC Swift Student Challenge projects.
